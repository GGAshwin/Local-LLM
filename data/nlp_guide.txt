Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, process, and generate human language. NLP is crucial for building intelligent systems that can interact with humans naturally.

Core NLP Tasks:
1. Tokenization: Breaking text into words or phrases
2. Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying grammatical roles
3. Named Entity Recognition: Extracting people, places, organizations
4. Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotional tone
5. Machine Translation: Converting text between languages
6. Text Classification: Categorizing documents
7. Question Answering: Finding answers to specific questions
8. Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries

Traditional NLP Approaches:
- Rule-based systems: Using manually crafted rules
- Statistical methods: Using probability and frequency
- Feature engineering: Creating meaningful representations

Modern NLP with Transformers:
Transformer models have revolutionized NLP by using attention mechanisms to understand context better. Key models include:
- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- ELECTRA: Efficiently Learning an Encoder
- RoBERTa: Robustly Optimized BERT

These models are trained on massive text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with minimal additional training.

Real-world NLP Applications:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Email spam detection
- Autocomplete and predictive text
- Machine translation services
- Sentiment analysis for social media
- Resume screening and recruitment
- Medical note analysis

NLP continues to enable more natural human-computer interaction.
