Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence by achieving state-of-the-art results in many domains.

Neural Network Fundamentals:
Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. They consist of:
- Input Layer: Receives data
- Hidden Layers: Process information through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces predictions or classifications

Each neuron applies an activation function to produce outputs. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

Deep Learning Architectures:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Excellent for image processing
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Designed for sequential data like text and time series
3. Transformers: State-of-the-art models for NLP and other domains
4. Autoencoders: Useful for dimensionality reduction and feature learning

Training Deep Networks:
Deep learning models require large amounts of data and computational power. Backpropagation is the key algorithm for training networks. GPUs and TPUs accelerate training significantly. Techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and regularization help prevent overfitting.

Applications of Deep Learning:
- Computer vision: Image classification, object detection, segmentation
- Natural language processing: Machine translation, text generation
- Game playing: Reinforcement learning in games like Chess and Go
- Generative models: Creating new content like images and text

Deep learning continues to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.
