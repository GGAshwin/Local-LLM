Machine Learning is a transformative field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. At its core, ML focuses on developing algorithms that can identify patterns in data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.

The Machine Learning Process:
1. Data Collection - Gathering relevant data
2. Data Preprocessing - Cleaning and preparing data
3. Feature Engineering - Selecting important attributes
4. Model Selection - Choosing an appropriate algorithm
5. Training - Teaching the model on historical data
6. Evaluation - Measuring performance on test data
7. Deployment - Using the model in production

Key Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled examples
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and rewards

Common Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Fraud detection
- Stock price prediction

Machine learning is revolutionizing industries and enabling AI systems to solve complex problems that were previously impossible to automate.
